Module 9 Challenge
###Overview of the analysis
Find temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. Use this data to examine if a surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable year-round.
###Results
-The standard deviation for both June and December is between 3-4, making it relatively small and meaning the temperature during those months does not change drastically. 
-The June minimumn temperature is 8 degrees higher than December's while the max is only 2 degrees. We can infer from this that while nights are cooler in December the days are not much cooler.
-The mean temperatures for both December and June are both in the low 70's
